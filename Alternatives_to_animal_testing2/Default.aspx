        <p>This is the photo of the dog, 'Geongangie' when she was alive.  
        Her name means 'healthy' in Korean, but she suffered from sevearly painful animal testing every week even though she had several health conditions.  
        She died in the Kyeongbook veterinarian lab where no sunlight, no wind, no help or rescue could reach.  
        One of the students in the lab took the courage and reported what has been going on there.  
        Let's not too late to save other lab animals!</p>

        <p>The Kyeongbook veterinarian college students reported unethical animal testings done by the professor to the Korean animal protection group.  
        Thank to those students, Korea got to know how the animals are treated in the universities labs.  
        Many students find out their curriculum requires unnecessary animal testing, too.  The students need to have the option to choose the alternatives to animal testing.  
        The person who revleals the unethical animal testing must be protected by the law and respected by the public.</p>
